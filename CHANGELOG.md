# agent-browser

## 0.21.2

### Patch Changes

- 757626f: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Deduplicate text content in snapshots** - Fixed an issue where duplicate text content appeared in page snapshots (#909)
  - **Native mouse drag state** - Fixed incorrect raw native mouse drag state not being properly tracked across `down`, `move`, and `up` events (#872)
  - **Chrome headless launch failures** - Fixed browser launch failures caused by the `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader` flag in Chrome headless mode (#915)
  - **Origin-scoped `--headers` persistence** - Restored correct persistence of origin-scoped headers set via `--headers` across navigation commands (#894)
  - **Relative URLs in WebSocket domain filter** - Fixed handling of relative URLs in the WebSocket domain filter script (#624)

## 0.21.1

### Patch Changes

- 1e7619d: ### New Features

  - **HAR 1.2 network capture** - Added commands to capture and export network traffic in HAR 1.2 format, including accurate request/response timing, headers, body sizes, and resource types sourced from Chrome DevTools Protocol events (#864)
  - **Built-in `upgrade` command** - Added `agent-browser upgrade` to self-update the CLI; automatically detects your installation method (npm, Homebrew, or Cargo) and runs the appropriate update command (#898)

  ### Documentation

  - Added `upgrade` command to the README command reference and installation guide
  - Added a dedicated **Updating** section to the README with usage instructions for `agent-browser upgrade`

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- c6de80b: ### New Features

  - **`batch` command** -- Execute multiple commands from stdin in a single invocation. Accepts a JSON array of string arrays and returns results sequentially. Supports `--bail` to stop on first error and `--json` for structured output (#865)
  - **iframe support** -- CLI interactions and snapshots now traverse into iframe content, enabling automation of cross-frame pages (#869)
  - **`network har start/stop` command** -- Capture and export network traffic in HAR 1.2 format (#874)
  - **WebSocket fallback for CDP discovery** -- When HTTP-based CDP endpoint discovery fails, the CLI now falls back to a WebSocket connection automatically (#873)

  ### Improvements

  - **`--full`/`-f` refactored to command-level flag** -- Moved from a global flag to a per-command flag for clearer scoping (#877)
  - **Enhanced Chrome launch** -- Added `--user-data-dir` support and configurable launch timeout for more reliable browser startup (#852)

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `/json/list` fallback when `/json/version` endpoint is unavailable, improving compatibility with non-standard CDP implementations (#861)
  - Fixed daemon liveness detection for PID namespace isolation (e.g. `unshare`). Uses socket connectivity as the sole liveness check instead of `kill(pid, 0)`, which fails when the caller cannot see the daemon's PID (#879)
  - Fixed Ubuntu dependency install accidentally removing system packages (#884)

## 0.20.14

### Patch Changes

- c0d4cf6: ### New Features

  - **Idle timeout for daemon auto-shutdown** - Added `--idle-timeout` CLI flag (and `AGENT_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable) to automatically shut down the daemon after a period of inactivity. Accepts human-friendly formats such as `10s`, `3m`, `1h`, or raw milliseconds (#856)
  - **Cursor-interactive elements in snapshot tree** - Cursor-interactive elements are now embedded directly into the snapshot tree for richer context (#855)

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed **remote host support** in CDP discovery, enabling connection to browsers running on non-local hosts (#854)
  - Fixed **CDP flag propagation** to the daemon process, ensuring reliable CDP reconnection across sessions (#857)
  - Fixed **Windows auto-connect profiling** to correctly handle browser connection on Windows (#835, #840)
  - Fixed **Windows transient error detection** by recognising Windows-specific socket error codes (`os error 10061` connection refused, `os error 10054` connection reset) during daemon reconnection attempts

## 0.20.13

### Patch Changes

- eda956b: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Network idle detection for cached pages** - Fixed an issue where `poll_network_idle` could return immediately when no network events were observed (e.g. pages served from cache). The idle timer is now only satisfied after a consistent **500 ms idle period** has elapsed, preventing false-positive idle detection. The core polling logic has also been extracted into a standalone `poll_network_idle` function to improve testability (#847)

## 0.20.12

### Patch Changes

- 5fa2396: ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed **`snapshot -C`** and **`screenshot --annotate`** hanging when connected over WSS (WebSocket Secure) due to sequential CDP round-trips per interactive element (#842)

  ### Performance

  - **`snapshot -C` (cursor-interactive mode)** now batches CDP calls instead of issuing N×2 sequential round-trips per cursor-interactive element, preventing timeouts on high-latency WSS connections (#842)
  - **`screenshot --annotate`** now batches element queries, reducing completion time from potentially 20–40s (e.g. 50+ buttons over WSS) to within expected bounds (#842)

## 0.20.11

### Patch Changes

- 4b5fc78: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Material Design checkbox/radio parity** - Restored Playwright-parity behavior for `check`/`uncheck` actions on Material Design controls. These components hide the native `<input>` off-screen and use overlay elements that intercept coordinate-based clicks; the actions now detect this pattern and fall back to a JS `.click()` to correctly toggle state. Also improves `ischecked` to handle nested hidden inputs and ARIA-only checkboxes (#837)
  - **Punctuation handling in `type` command** - Fixed incorrect virtual key (VK) codes being used for punctuation characters (e.g. `.`, `@`) in the `type` action, which previously caused those characters to be dropped or mistyped (#836)

## 0.20.10

### Patch Changes

- a3d9662: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Restored WebSocket streaming** - Fixed broken WebSocket streaming in the native daemon by keeping the **StreamServer** instance alive so the broadcast channel remains open, and ensuring CDP session IDs and connection status are correctly propagated to stream clients (#826)
  - **Filtered internal Chrome targets** - Fixed auto-connect discovery incorrectly attempting to attach to Chrome-internal pages (e.g. `chrome://`, `chrome-extension://`, `devtools://` URLs), which could cause unexpected connection failures (#827)

## 0.20.9

### Patch Changes

- 51d9ab4: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Appium v3 iOS capabilities** - Added `appium:` vendor prefix to iOS capabilities (e.g., `appium:automationName`, `appium:deviceName`, `appium:platformVersion`) to comply with the Appium v3 WebDriver protocol requirements (#810)
  - **Snapshot `--selector` scoping** - Fixed `snapshot --selector` so that the output is properly scoped to the matched element's subtree rather than returning the full accessibility tree. The selector now resolves the target DOM node's backend IDs and filters the accessibility tree to only include nodes within that subtree (#825)

## 0.20.8

### Patch Changes

- daf7263: ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed **video duration** being reported incorrectly when using real-time ffmpeg encoding for screen recording (#812)
  - Removed obsolete **`BrowserManager` TypeScript API** references that no longer reflect the current CLI-based usage model (#821)

  ### Documentation

  - Updated README to replace outdated **`BrowserManager` programmatic API** examples with the current CLI-based approach using `execSync` and `agent-browser` commands (#821)
  - Removed the **Programmatic API** section covering `BrowserManager` screencast and input injection methods, which are no longer part of the public API (#821)

## 0.20.7

### Patch Changes

- 25a1526: ### New Features

  - **Brave Browser support** - Added auto-discovery of Brave Browser for CDP connections on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The agent will now automatically detect and connect to Brave alongside Chrome, Chromium, and Canary installations (#817)

  ### Improvements

  - **Postinstall message** - The post-install message now detects existing Chrome installations on the system. If a compatible browser is found, it confirms the path and notes it will be used automatically instead of prompting an install. If no browser is detected, the warning is clearer and mentions that installation can be skipped when using `--cdp`, `--provider`, `--engine`, or `--executable-path` (#815)

## 0.20.6

### Patch Changes

- fa91c22: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Stale accessibility tree reference fallback** - Fixed an issue where interacting with an element whose **`backend_node_id`** had become stale (e.g. after the DOM was replaced) would fail with a `Could not compute box model` CDP error. Element resolution now re-queries the accessibility tree using role/name lookup to obtain a fresh node ID before retrying the operation (#806)

## 0.20.5

### Patch Changes

- fc091d2: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Daemon panic on broken stderr pipe** - Replaced all `eprintln!` calls with `writeln!(std::io::stderr(), ...)` wrapped in `let _ =` to silently discard write errors, preventing the daemon from panicking when the parent process drops the stderr pipe during Chrome launch (#802)

## 0.20.4

### Patch Changes

- e2ebde2: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Broadcast channel lag handling** - Fixed an issue where **broadcast channel lag** errors were incorrectly treated as stream closure, causing premature termination of event listeners in reload, response body, download, and navigation wait operations. Lagged messages are now skipped and the loop continues instead of breaking (#797)

  ### Improvements

  - Removed unused **pnpm setup** steps from the `global-install` CI job, simplifying the workflow configuration (#798)

## 0.20.3

### Patch Changes

- e365909: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Chrome launch retry** - Chrome will now retry launching up to 3 times with a 500ms delay between attempts, improving resilience against transient startup failures (#791)
  - **Remote CDP snapshot hang** - Resolved an issue where snapshots would hang indefinitely over remote CDP (WSS) connections by removing WebSocket message and frame size limits to accommodate large responses (e.g. `Accessibility.getFullAXTree`), accepting binary frames from remote proxies such as Browserless, and immediately clearing pending commands when the connection closes rather than waiting for the 30-second timeout (#792)

## 0.20.2

### Patch Changes

- 944fa01: ### New Features

  - **Linux musl (Alpine) builds** - Added pre-built binaries for **linux-musl** targeting both **x64** and **arm64** architectures, enabling native support for Alpine Linux and other musl-based distributions without requiring glibc (#784)

  ### Improvements

  - **Consecutive `--auto-connect` commands** - Added support for issuing multiple consecutive `--auto-connect` commands without requiring a full browser relaunch; external connections are now correctly identified and reused (#786)
  - **External browser disconnect behavior** - When using `--auto-connect` or `--cdp`, closing the agent session now disconnects cleanly without shutting down the user's browser process

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Restored `refs` dict in `--json` snapshot output** - The `refs` map containing role and name metadata for referenced elements is now correctly included in JSON snapshot responses (#787)
  - Fixed e2e test assertions for `diff_snapshot` and `domain_filter` to correctly reflect expected behavior (#783)
  - Fixed Chrome temp-dir cleanup test failing on Windows (#766)

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- bd05917: ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed **AX tree deserialization** to accept integer `nodeId` and `childIds` values for compatibility with Lightpanda, which sends numeric IDs where Chrome sends strings (#775)
  - Fixed **misleading SIGPIPE comment** to accurately describe the default Rust SIGPIPE behavior and why it is reset to `SIG_DFL` (#776)
  - Fixed **WebM recording output** to use the VP9 codec (`libvpx-vp9`) instead of H.264, producing valid WebM files; also adds a padding filter to ensure even frame dimensions (#779)

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 235fa88: ### Full Native Rust

  - **100% native Rust** -- Removed the entire Node.js/Playwright daemon. The Rust native daemon is now the only implementation. No Node.js runtime or Playwright dependency required. (#754)
  - **99x smaller install** -- Install size reduced from 710 MB to 7 MB by eliminating the Node.js dependency tree.
  - **18x less memory** -- Daemon memory usage reduced from 143 MB to 8 MB.
  - **1.6x faster cold start** -- Cold start time reduced from 1002ms to 617ms.

  - Fixed "not found" error pattern in `to_ai_friendly_error` incorrectly catching non-element errors (#759)
  - Fixed storage local key lookup parsing and text output (#761)
  - Fixed Lightpanda engine launch with release binaries (#760)
  - Hardened Lightpanda startup timeouts (#762)

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 56bb92b: ### New Features

  - **Browserless.io provider** -- Added browserless.io as a browser provider, supported in both Node.js and native daemon paths. Connect to remote Browserless instances with `--provider browserless` or `AGENT_BROWSER_PROVIDER=browserless`. Configurable via `BROWSERLESS_API_KEY`, `BROWSERLESS_API_URL`, and `BROWSERLESS_BROWSER_TYPE` environment variables. (#502, #746)
  - **`clipboard` command** -- Read from and write to the browser clipboard. Supports `read`, `write <text>`, `copy` (simulates Ctrl+C), and `paste` (simulates Ctrl+V) operations. (#749)
  - **Screenshot output configuration** -- New global flags `--screenshot-dir`, `--screenshot-quality`, `--screenshot-format` and corresponding `AGENT_BROWSER_SCREENSHOT_DIR`, `AGENT_BROWSER_SCREENSHOT_QUALITY`, `AGENT_BROWSER_SCREENSHOT_FORMAT` environment variables for persistent screenshot settings. (#749)

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed `wait --text` not working in native daemon path (#749)
  - Fixed `BrowserManager.navigate()` and package entry point (#748)
  - Fixed extensions not being loaded from `config.json` (#750)
  - Fixed scroll on page load (#747)
  - Fixed HTML retrieval by using `browser.getLocator()` for selector operations (#745)

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 942b8cd: ### New Features

  - **`inspect` command** - Opens Chrome DevTools for the active page by launching a local proxy server that forwards the DevTools frontend to the browser's CDP WebSocket. Commands continue to work while DevTools is open. Implemented in both Node.js and native paths. (#736)
  - **`get cdp-url` subcommand** - Retrieve the Chrome DevTools Protocol WebSocket URL for the active page, useful for external debugging tools. (#736)
  - **Native screenshot annotate** - The `--annotate` flag for screenshots now works in the native Rust daemon, bringing parity with the Node.js path. (#706)

  ### Improvements

  - **KERNEL_API_KEY now optional** - External credential injection no longer requires `KERNEL_API_KEY` to be set, making it easier to use Kernel with pre-configured environments. (#687)
  - **Browserbase simplified** - Removed the `BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID` requirement, reducing setup friction for Browserbase users. (#625)

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed Browserbase API using incorrect endpoint to release sessions (#707)
  - Fixed CDP connect paths using hardcoded 10s timeout instead of `getDefaultTimeout()` (#704)
  - Fixed lone Unicode surrogates causing errors by sanitizing with `toWellFormed()` (#720)
  - Fixed CDP connection failure on IPv6-first systems (#717)
  - Fixed recordings not inheriting the current viewport settings (#718)

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- 94cd888: Added support for device scale factor (retina display) in the viewport command via an optional scale parameter. Also added webview target type support for better Electron application compatibility, and the pages list now includes target type information.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 94521e7: ### New Features

  - **Lightpanda browser engine support** - Added `--engine <name>` flag to select the browser engine (`chrome` by default, or `lightpanda`), implying `--native` mode. Configurable via `AGENT_BROWSER_ENGINE` environment variable (#646)
  - **Dialog dismiss command** - Added support for `dismiss` subcommand in dialog command parsing (#605)

  ### Improvements

  - **Daemon startup error reporting** - Daemon startup errors are now surfaced directly instead of showing an opaque timeout message (#614)
  - **CDP port discovery** - Replaced broken hand-rolled HTTP client with `reqwest` for more reliable CDP port discovery (#619)
  - **Chrome extensions** - Extensions now load correctly by forcing headed mode when extensions are present (#652)
  - **Google Translate bar suppression** - Suppressed the Google Translate bar in native headless mode to avoid interference (#649)
  - **Auth cookie persistence** - Auth cookies are now persisted on browser close in native mode (#650)

  ### Documentation

  - Improved snapshot usage guidance and added reproducibility check (#630)
  - Added `--engine` flag to the README options table

  ### Performance

  - Added benchmarks to the CLI codebase (#637)

## 0.16.3

### Patch Changes

- 7d2c895: Fixed an issue where the --native flag was being passed to child processes even when not explicitly specified on the command line. The flag is now only forwarded when the user explicitly provides it, consistent with how other CLI flags like --allow-file-access and --download-path are handled.

## 0.16.2

### Patch Changes

- 01ac557: Added AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED environment variable support for running the browser in headed mode, and improved temporary profile cleanup when launching Chrome directly. Also includes documentation clarification that browser extensions work in both headed and headless modes.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- c4180c8: Improved Chrome launch reliability by automatically detecting containerized environments (Docker, Podman, Kubernetes) and enabling --no-sandbox when needed. Added support for discovering Playwright-installed Chromium browsers and enhanced error messages with helpful diagnostics when Chrome fails to launch.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 05018b3: Added experimental native Rust daemon (`--native` flag, `AGENT_BROWSER_NATIVE=1` env, or `"native": true` in config). The native daemon communicates with Chrome directly via CDP, eliminating Node.js and Playwright dependencies. Supports 150+ commands with full parity to the default Node.js daemon. Includes WebDriver backend for Safari/iOS, CDP protocol codegen, request tracking, frame context management, and comprehensive e2e and parity tests.

## 0.15.3

### Patch Changes

- 62241b5: Fixed Windows compatibility issues including proper handling of extended-length path prefixes from canonicalize(), prevention of MSYS/Git Bash path translation that could mangle arguments, and improved daemon startup reliability. Also added ARM64 Windows support in postinstall shims and expanded CI testing with a full daemon lifecycle test on Windows.

## 0.15.2

### Patch Changes

- 6aea316: Documentation site improvements and internal tooling updates including enhanced code blocks, mobile navigation, and docs chat components. CLI connection and output handling refinements. Skill creator reference documentation and scripts have been reorganized.

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- 7bd8ce9: Added support for chrome:// and chrome-extension:// URLs in navigation and recording commands. These special browser URLs are now preserved as-is instead of having https:// incorrectly prepended.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e38882: - Added security hardening: authentication vault, content boundary markers, domain allowlist, action policy, action confirmation, and output length limits.
  - Added `--download-path` flag (and `AGENT_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD_PATH` env / `downloadPath` config key) to set a default download directory.
  - Added `--selector` flag to `scroll` command for scrolling within specific container elements.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- b7665e5: - Added `keyboard` command for raw keyboard input -- type with real keystrokes, insert text, and press shortcuts at the currently focused element without needing a selector.
  - Added `--color-scheme` flag and `AGENT_BROWSER_COLOR_SCHEME` env var for persistent dark/light mode preference across browser sessions.
  - Fixed IPC EAGAIN errors (os error 35/11) by adding backpressure-aware socket writes, command serialization, and lowering the default Playwright timeout to 25s (configurable via `AGENT_BROWSER_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`).
  - Fixed remote debugging (CDP) reconnection.
  - Fixed state load failing when no browser is running.
  - Fixed `--annotate` flag warning appearing when not explicitly passed via CLI.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- ebd8717: Added new diff commands for comparing snapshots, screenshots, and URLs between page states. You can now run visual pixel diffs against baseline images, compare accessibility tree snapshots with customizable depth and selectors, and diff two URLs side-by-side with optional screenshot comparison.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 69ffad0: Add annotated screenshots with the new --annotate flag, which overlays numbered labels on interactive elements and prints a legend mapping each label to its element ref. This enables multimodal AI models to reason about visual layout while using the same @eN refs for subsequent interactions. The flag can also be set via the AGENT_BROWSER_ANNOTATE environment variable.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- c6fc7df: Added documentation for command chaining with && across README, CLI help output, docs, and skill files, explaining how to efficiently chain multiple agent-browser commands in a single shell invocation since the browser persists via a background daemon.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 5dc40b4: Added configuration file support with automatic loading from user and project directories, new profiler commands for Chrome DevTools profiling, computed styles getter, browser extension loading, storage state management, and iOS device emulation. Expanded click command with new-tab option, improved find command with additional actions and filtering options, and enhanced CDP connection to accept WebSocket URLs. Documentation has been significantly expanded with new sections for configuration, profiling, and proxy support.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- ae34945: Added --allow-file-access flag to enable opening and interacting with local file:// URLs (PDFs, HTML files) by passing Chromium flags that allow JavaScript access to local files. Added -C/--cursor flag for snapshots to include cursor-interactive elements like divs with onclick handlers or cursor:pointer styles, which is useful for modern web apps using custom clickable elements.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d021bd: Add iOS Simulator and real device support for mobile Safari testing via Appium. New CLI commands include `device list` to show available simulators, `tap` and `swipe` for touch interactions, and the `--device` flag to specify which iOS device to use. Configure with `-p ios` provider flag or `AGENT_BROWSER_PROVIDER=ios` environment variable.

## 0.8.10

### Patch Changes

- 17dba8f: Add --stdin flag for eval command to read JavaScript from stdin, enabling heredoc usage for multiline scripts
- daeede4: Add --stdin flag for the eval command to read JavaScript from stdin, enabling heredoc usage for multiline scripts. Also fix binary permission issues on macOS/Linux when postinstall scripts don't run (e.g., with bun).

## 0.8.9

### Patch Changes

- 0dc36f2: Add --stdin flag for eval command to read JavaScript from stdin, enabling heredoc usage for multiline scripts

## 0.8.8

### Patch Changes

- 2771588: Added base64 encoding support for the eval command with -b/--base64 flag to avoid shell escaping issues when executing JavaScript. Updated documentation with AI agent setup instructions and reorganized the docs structure by consolidating agent mode content into the installation page.

## 0.8.7

### Patch Changes

- d24f753: Fixed browser launch options not being passed correctly when using persistent profiles, ensuring args, userAgent, proxy, and ignoreHTTPSErrors settings now work properly. Added pre-flight checks for socket path length limits and directory write permissions to provide clearer error messages when daemon startup fails. Improved error handling to properly exit with failure status when browser launch fails.

## 0.8.6

### Patch Changes

- d75350a: Improved daemon connection reliability by adding automatic retry logic for transient errors like connection resets, broken pipes, and temporary resource unavailability. The CLI now cleans up stale socket and PID files before starting a new daemon, and includes better detection of daemon responsiveness to handle race conditions during shutdown.

## 0.8.5

### Patch Changes

- cb2f8c3: Fixed version synchronization to automatically update Cargo.lock alongside Cargo.toml during releases, and made the CLI binary executable. This ensures the Rust CLI version stays in sync with the npm package version.

## 0.8.4

### Patch Changes

- 759302e: Fixed "Daemon not found" error when running through AI agents (e.g., Claude Code) by resolving symlinks in the executable path. Previously, npm global bin symlinks weren't being resolved correctly, causing intermittent daemon discovery failures.

## 0.8.3

### Patch Changes

- 4116a8a: Replaced shell-based CLI wrappers with a cross-platform Node.js wrapper to enable npx support on Windows. Added postinstall logic to patch npm's bin entry on global installs, allowing the native binary to be invoked directly with zero overhead. Added CI tests to verify global installation works correctly across all platforms.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 7e6336f: Fixed the Windows CMD wrapper to use the native binary directly instead of routing through Node.js, improving startup performance and reliability. Added retry logic to the CI install command to handle transient failures during browser installation.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 8eec634: Improved release workflow to validate binary file sizes and ensure binaries are executable after npm install. Updated documentation site with a new mobile navigation system and added v0.8.0 changelog entries. Reformatted CHANGELOG.md for better readability.

## v0.8.0

### New Features

- **Kernel cloud browser provider** - Connect to Kernel (https://kernel.sh) for remote browser infrastructure via `-p kernel` flag or `AGENT_BROWSER_PROVIDER=kernel`. Supports stealth mode, persistent profiles, and automatic profile find-or-create.

### Security

- Daemon and stream server now reject cross-origin connections (#274)

## 0.7.6

### Patch Changes

- a4d0c26: Allow null values for the screenshot selector field. Previously, passing a null selector would fail validation, but now it is properly handled as an optional value.

## 0.7.5

### Patch Changes

- 8c2a6ec: Fix GitHub release workflow to handle existing releases. If a release already exists, binaries are uploaded to it instead of failing.

## 0.7.4

### Patch Changes

- 957b5e5: Fix binary permissions on install. npm doesn't preserve execute bits, so postinstall now ensures the native binary is executable.

## 0.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 161d8f5: Fix native binary distribution in npm package. Native binaries for all platforms (Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, Windows x64) are now correctly included when publishing.

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 6afede2: Fix native binary distribution in npm package

  Native binaries for all platforms (Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, Windows x64) are now included in the npm package. Previously, the release workflow published to npm before building binaries, causing "No binary found" errors on installation.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix native binary distribution in npm package. Native binaries for all platforms (Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, Windows x64) are now included in the npm package. Previously, the release workflow published to npm before building binaries, causing "No binary found" errors on installation.
